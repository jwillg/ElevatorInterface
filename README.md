# Elevator Analysis
## Elevator Information

The elevator I chose to analyze is the Electrical and Computor Engineering building's elevator.

## Issues with the current design

The information that an elevator interface has should be formatted in a natural and logical way. Having the listed in a horizontal line makes people look twice before selecting the correct floor. It’s more natural to have a vertical interface.

In addition, the buttons are all over the place, the most used ones should be nearest to the entrance (in this case the panel is on the right of the elevator). Also, elevator key switches should be moved away from the buttons as to not clutter the location where the floor and emergency buttons are.

## Common and uncommon uses of an elevator

Common uses: to quickly move up and down the floors, to move larger objects to different floors, to move up and down multiple stories that would be difficult to walk (i.e. floor 1 to floor 8).

Uncommon uses: unable to use stairs due to injury, unable to use stairs due to disbility.

## The sequence of actions taken when an elevator is used

1) the user selects the direction they want to travel using the external interface
2) the user selects the floor which the want to travel
3a) the user presses the hold door open button until all passengers have entered
3b) the user presses the close door button

## How an elevator helps the user understand how it works

The elevator helps the user understand how it works visual items like floor numbers and colors (i.e. read for emergency buttons). The location of the buttons also plays a big part, the floors that are at the top of the building should be placed above those below it.

## How an elevator provides feedback to the user

The elevator provides feedback to the user by using lights or sounds to indicate the user selected something or that a process has come to an end. For example, the button the user selected lights up and when the floor is reached a sound is played.

## Common mistakes in this design

It’s easy to select the wrong floor because of the horizontal design. Especially for blind users, because they need to put read the braille in order to select the right floor and may accidentally brush their hands over the other floor buttons.

The fact that there are seemingly 3 different emergency buttons are confusing. Assuming they do the same thing, they should be combined into one emergency button or an alarm button and emergency button (which alert the building personnel or elevator service technician respectively).
